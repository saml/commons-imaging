<section name="Commons Imaging: a Pure-Java Image Library">

    <p>
      Apache Commons Imaging, previously known as Apache Commons Sanselan, is a library that
      reads and writes a variety of image formats, including fast parsing
      of image info (size, color space, ICC profile, etc.) and metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      This library is pure Java. Compared to typical image I/O libraries in native code,
      it's more portable, and should be more reliable and more secure against corrupt/malicious
      images, yet still performs reasonably well.
      It's easier to use than ImageIO/JAI/java.awt.Toolkit (Sun/Java's image support), supports
      more formats (and supports them more correctly). It also provides easy access to metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imaging was working and was used by a number of projects in production even before version 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is Open Source; free as in freedom and free as in beer.
      It is available under the ASF (Apache) License. This is a non-viral Open Source license.
